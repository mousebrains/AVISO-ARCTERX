# AVISO-ARCTERX
Identifying tracks for the ARCTERX cruises

- `tracks.subset.spatial.py` should be run first and extracts all tracks that have ever existed in a lat/lon box.
- `tracks.subset.temporal.py` should be run next on the spatially subseted data. This pulls out all tracks that existed on the calendar months and days specified.

You should download the data from AVISO, but there is a set for testing available at [https://arcterx.ceoas.oregonstate.edu/AVISO/data/](ARCTERX-AVISO.)
